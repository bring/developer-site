EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) in Bring and Posten started in the 90s.
EDI Guidelines based on different versions of EDIFACT and API have been
published since then, IFTMIN S93A, D97A and API. Todayâ€™s version is based on
the D04A standards.

Bring and Posten still support some early versions, however they will not be
updated with changes. We strongly suggest all our clients to use IFTMIN D04A
(or API).
