    Bring is revising the service portfolio. Some of our services have been
    given new service names, service codes and pricing models.

  <p>
    Old services will be phased out. From a given date, your company will be
    converted to use revised services during Booking, and you can no longer book
    old services. All customers belongs to your company will be converted. The
    revised services are booked using main customer number.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Reports API , we have made changes to support Main Customer Number for
    some service types and for some service types new definitions are available.
  </p>
  <p>
    API users after conversion need to use appropriate customer number and
    definition combination to get the correct result set from the reports.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend API users to execute
    <a href="/api/reports/#list-available-customers"
      >List available customers</a
    >
    and
    <a href="/api/reports/#list-available-reports-for-a-customer"
      >List available reports for a customer</a
    >
    to understand what parameters to be used for report execution.
