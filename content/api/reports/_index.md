      The first two steps in the process is only necessary to find customer numbers and report types for the user. You can save these IDs, and perform the generation-step without verifying the IDs. The response may get added information, so implementation should ignore new elements added to the response.

      1. Get the customers IDs
      2. Get the list of report types available for the customer
      3. Initiate report creation and get the report ID. The Report ID is initially used to monitor reports creation progress, later to get the actual report (XML or Excel file).
      4. After initiating report creation, you can check the status, if itâ€™s in-progress, completed or failed. When completed, a URL to the actual report is returned.
      5. Download report
      6. Get list of invoice numbers for given customer or group
