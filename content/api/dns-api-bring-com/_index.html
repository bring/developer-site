<section class="dev-docscontent__section">

  <p>
    Bring's applications and infrastructure are going through bigger changes, as part
    of modernizing our infrastructure. One of these changes, is update of our
    load balancing component, and that will affect services running on <code>api.bring.com</code>.
    This page explains this upcoming change, the time schedule and how you as a customer can adapt it.
  </p>

  <h2>Upcoming change</h2>

  <p>
    At <strong>1st of April</strong> we will switch DNS for <code>api.bring.com</code> to point to a new
    load balancer component. This change will have the following affects:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Change of IP address</li>
    <li>Change of certificate</li>
    <li>Remove support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is a big change, but most of our API customers won't be affected. Updated and modern clients
    will not be affected. But we know there are older clients in use, and these will need an update
    to work with the new load balancer. Clients running on Java 6 and Java 7 are some of the unsupported clients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Check the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=api%2dnew.bring.com&latest">certificate details</a> for the new certificate.
  </p>

  <h2>Already tested once</h2>

  <p>
    We have already done the change once, to get a feeling how such a change would affect our customers.
    At Wednesday 13th of October (first half of the day), we did the DNS switch temporary, while monitoring our API usage across
    our services. We did not experience bigger changes in requests/responses, that proved that most customers will not
    be affected of the upcoming change.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have also done the similar switch for <code>www.mybring.com</code>.
    This change was done without informing customers, since we didn't expect many problems. Browsers today
    will not have problems with change of certificate and removal of outdated TLS versions.
  </p>

  <h2>Test and switch without downtime</h2>

  <p>
    We want to make this change in a way that won't cause downtime for our customers. We will do a step-by-step
    approach, so customers can switch at their end without doing it at the same time as we do our changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have
    created a new, temporary domain <code>api-new.bring.com</code>, that you can start using today. This
    domain points to the future load balancer, and it uses the same backend services in production. That means
    you can verify and switch to this temporary domain when all looks good. After we have done our switch of
    <code>api.bring.com</code>, you can switch back to the regular url. This should just be a simple change
    of url, since it will point to the same IP at this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the approach above, we can do our changes independent of each other. This will ensure no sudden
    problems at your end when we do our DNS change. It is also possible that you just verify against
    <code>api-new.bring.com</code>, but continue to use <code>api.bring.com</code> if you experience no
    problems. With this approach, you will only need to verify once and not remember to switch back from
    the temporary domain.
  </p>

  <h2>Time schedule</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Today:</strong> DNS <code>api-new.bring.com</code> is available for customers to use.</li>
    <li><strong>January - March:</strong> Customers switch towards <code>api-new.bring.com</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>1st of April:</strong> Bring changes DNS for <code>api.bring.com</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>April - June:</strong> Customers switch back towards <code>api.bring.com</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>4th of July:</strong> Bring removes the temporary DNS <code>api-new.bring.com</code>.</li>
  </ul>
