          <h3>1 Minimum and maximum lead time</h3>
          <p>
            To properly use the ETA from Posten / Bring, you need to account for
            your internal lead time. While we recommend having as precise ETA as
            possible, we understand that sometimes, a range is needed to account
            for uncertainties or large volumes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A value 0 in both variables would mean that as long as the order is
            placed before the cut-off time, it will be handed over to Bring
            today, and you can provide the user an exact estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the min and max lead time are different values, you should
            provide the user with a range instead of an exact date. Note that
            users generally read a range estimate as the worst estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            For exact date, use the <code>expectedDeliveryDate</code> response,
            for a range, use <code>workingDays</code>

        <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
          <h3>2 Cut-off time</h3>
          <p>
            To increase precision for end users, we suggest implementing a
            cut-off time. The cut-off time is the latest time a customer can
            order, and expect the order to be handled within the specified lead
            time. Orders placed after the cut-off will have an additional day
            added to the delivery estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cut-off time can also be shown to the end user, both for providing
            transparency into what they can expect, and how they can benefit
            from ordering now, instead of later.

          <h3>1 Ask the user for their address and area code</h3>
          <p>
            Some area codes are split into several delivery zones to keep costs
            down, which impacts lead time. The general rule is that population
            hubs will have more frequent delivery than the rest of the area
            code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, we recommend that you query our APIs with both
            postal code and address.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will still be instances where it is not possible to accurately
            provide a lead time, for example if the address is misspelled. You
            will then receive the following warning in the shipping guide
            response.

  }{{< /highlight >}}
          </div>

          <p>
            If this code is received, the estimate is the default for the postal
            code, which can be used for showing an estimated delivery time, but
            you should not allow the customer to select a specific date, as the
            returned alternate delivery dates might be wrong for the actual
            delivery address.

          <h3>2 Show an estimated delivery as a range</h3>
          <p>
            When you have uncertain lead times, it is recommended to show the
            estimated delivery day as a range. In this example, the internal
            lead time might be 0 - 1 days. The min and max values of internal
            lead time should be added to Bring's
            <code>workingDays</code> variable from Shipping Guide.

          <h3>3 Estimated time (hh:mm) package will be ready for pickup</h3>
          <p>
            For the Pickup Parcel service, you can show additional details about
            the estimated delivery time. Based on machine learning, shipping
            guide provides the time of day when the package will be ready for
            pickup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the <code>estimateddeliverytime</code> query parameter to get
            the delivery time.

            Home delivery has the option to order a specific date of delivery.
            For these kind of services, you can show a "from" value for the
            estimated time, to give users a hint that they may select other
            options when exploring the shipping method.

          <h3>5 Displaying the alternative delivery dates</h3>
          <p>
            A table or drop down are good ways to allow users to select the
            delivery date that fits their needs the best. You should also show
            the delivery window to make the package journey transparent for the
            customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our suggestion is to have a max of five alternate delivery dates, to
            not overload the user with choices. Pricing the options differently
            can help offsetting any extra costs for expedite handling in your
            warehouse.
