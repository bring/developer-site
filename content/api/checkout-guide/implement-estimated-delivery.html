    <p class="text-heading">
      By showing an estimated time of delivery, you are answering one of the
      most common questions customers shopping online are asking: when will my
      order arrive?
    </p>
    <p class="text-heading">
      There are a few things you need to bear in mind when setting this up:
    </p>

    <div class="message--warn maxw40r pam mvl">
      Your internal lead time is vital for a correct estimated delivery time
    </div>

    <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs maxw48r">
      <p>
        To use the lead times you receive from our APIs, you need to account for
        your own lead times as well and add them to the query as the shipping
        <code>date</code> and <code>time</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not provide the date and time for shipment handover to Bring
        when querying the Shipping Guide API, the response will assume the query
        time stamp is the shipment handover. E.g.: <code>date</code> = current
        date and <code>time</code> = current time stamp - the result will be an
        overly optimistic ETA in checkout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calculate your your shipping date and time <em>before</em> querying
        Shipping Guide.
      </p>
    </div>

        <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
          <h3>1&nbsp;Order&nbsp;placed&nbsp;before cut-off time</h3>
          <p>
            In the first case, the query to shipping guide will use today as
            shipping <code>date</code>, and 21:00 or blank as shipping
            <code>time</code>. A typical Bring lead time for packages to larger
            cities is one day, and the end user will be shown "tomorrow" as
            their delivery estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cut-off time can also be shown to the end user, both for providing
            transparency into what they can expect, and how they can benefit
            from ordering now, instead of later.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
          <h3>2 Order placed after cut-off time</h3>
          <p>
            In the second example, the same webshop gets an order at 19:00.
            Orders placed after 17:00 will not be packed in time for the pickup
            the same day. They do not need to be prioritised in the warehouse,
            and will be picked the next day. An additional day is added to the
            webshop lead time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, the query will set <code>date</code> = tomorrow’s
            date. With the same Bring distribution lead time, the end user will
            be shown "2 days" as their delivery estimate.

          The examples below show a webshop with default 4 hours lead time from
          order placement in the webshop, which would be a warehouse lead time
          of "0 days". The last Bring pickup is at 21:00. As such, cut-off is
          set to 17:00, as orders placed before that time will leave the
          warehouse the same day.

      <h3>Internal lead time as min-max values</h3>
      <p>
        While we recommend having as precise estimated delivery time as
        possible, we understand that sometimes, a range is needed to account for
        uncertainties or large volumes. By configuring internal lead time from
        minimum to maximum, you get this flexibility.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the value for both minimum and maximum lead time
          <em>is equal</em>, (e.g.: 0–0 days) you are able to present an
          <em>exact estimated delivery date</em> in checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the value for minimum and maximum lead time
          <em>differ</em> (e.g.: 1–2 days), you should provide the user with
          <em>a range instead of exact date</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For exact date, use the <code>expectedDeliveryDate</code> response from
        shipping guide, for a range, use <code>workingDays</code>.

          <h3>1 Ask the user for their address and postal code</h3>
          <p>
            Some postal codes are split into several delivery zones, which
            impacts lead time for parcel to mailbox and home delivery. The
            general rule is that population hubs will have more frequent
            delivery than the rest of the postal code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, we recommend that you query our APIs with both
            postal code and address.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will still be instances where it is not possible to accurately
            provide a lead time, for example if the address is misspelled. You
            will then receive the following warning in the shipping guide
            response.

            If this code is received, the estimate is the default for the postal
            code, which can be used for showing an estimated delivery time, but
            you should not allow the customer to select a specific date, as the
            returned alternate delivery dates might be wrong for the actual
            delivery address.

        <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
          <h3>2 Show estimated delivery time as a range</h3>
          <p>
            When you have uncertain lead times, it is recommended to show the
            estimated delivery day as a range (see "Configure internal minimum
            and maximum lead time" above).
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, the internal lead time might be 0–1 days. The min
            and max values of internal lead time should be added to Bring’s
            <code>workingDays</code> variable from Shipping Guide.

          <h3>3 Estimated time (hh:mm) package will be ready for pickup</h3>
          <p>
            For the Pickup Parcel service, in addition to showing estimated
            <em>day of arrival</em>, you can show the estimated
            <em>time</em> when the parcel will be ready for pickup at the pickup
            point location. This service is based on machine learning and is
            kept continually updated.

          <p>
            Use the <code>estimateddeliverytime</code> query parameter to get
            the delivery time.

            Home delivery has the option to order
            <em>a specific date of delivery</em>. For these kind of services,
            you may show a <code>from</code> value for the estimated time in the
            service description, to give users a hint that they may select other
            options when exploring the shipping method.

          <h3>5 Displaying alternative delivery dates</h3>
          <p>
            A table or drop down are good ways to allow users to select the
            delivery date that fits their needs the best. You should also show
            the delivery time window to make the package journey transparent for
            the customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend presenting five possible delivery dates in the
            checkout. Pricing the options differently may help offsetting any
            extra costs for expedite handling in your warehouse.
