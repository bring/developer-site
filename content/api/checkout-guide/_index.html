    <p class="text-heading">
      To provide your customers with the best possible shopping experience in
      your e-commerce store, we recommend displaying relevant delivery
      information at checkout. Based on user research and testing, we have
      developed a best practice for presenting the most common B2C delivery
      methods in a webshop checkout. Our recommended e-commerce delivery
      services are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Package to mailbox</li>
      <li>Home delivery</li>
      <li>parcel to Pickup Point.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By offering these delivery options with additional services, your customer
      are able to select the delivery method best suited their needs. The best
      practice examples can be populated by using the
      <a href="../shipping-guide_2">Shipping Guide 2.0</a> and
      <a href="../pickup-point">Pickup Point</a> APIs.

          freight is one of the most powerful tool for increasing conversion.
          Subsidize all shipping methods equally so that the customer can pick
          the shipping method that best fits their needs, without price
          incentives overweighing a particular shipping method.
