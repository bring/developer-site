      To provide your customers with the best possible shopping experience in
      your e-commerce store, we recommend displaying relevant delivery
      information at checkout. Based on user research and testing, we have
      developed a best practice for presenting the most common B2C delivery
      methods in a webshop checkout. Our recommended e-commerce delivery
      services are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Package to mailbox</li>
      <li>Home delivery</li>
      <li>parcel to Pickup Point.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By offering these delivery options with additional services, your customer
      are able to select the delivery method best suited their needs. The best
      practice examples can be populated by using the
      <a href="../shipping-guide_2">Shipping Guide 2.0</a> and
      <a href="../pickup-point">Pickup Point</a> APIs.

          incentives overweighing a particular shipping method.
