        <h3>1 Delivery option Pakke til hentested</h3>
        <p>
          With more than 1700 pickup point locations across Norway, and an
          increasing number of package boxes being placed around the country
          (3000 will be in service by the end of 2021), your customers have a
          wide range of options for where to pick up their package. It is a
          flexible and safe delivery method.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend using [<code>displayName</code>] from the shipping guide
          as the delivery option label.

        <h3>2 Estimated delivery</h3>
        <p>
          Estimated delivery is the combination of your internal lead time and
          Posten / Bring lead time. For delivery to pickup point, estimated time
          is available in addition to the estimated date.
        </p>

          You have some options for presentation depending on your shipping
          routines. For more detailed information, see

        <h3>4 Choose pickup point</h3>
        <p>
          If the user selects Pickup point parcel, the best practice is to expand and
          show a drop down list for pickup points. See the illustration of the
          dropdown for pickup points, it should display 5–7 closest
          pickup points. An additional best practice is to allow the user to
          search based on a postal code, as some users might want to pick up
          their package in a different location than near their home.
        </p>
        <b>Package box </b>
        <p>
          If the user choose package box (Type 37), let them know that they need
          the Posten app, and if the package is too big it will go to nearest pickup
          point. Package box can be identified by PickupPointType = Type 37
