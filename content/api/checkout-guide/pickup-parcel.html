          choice in where to pick up their package. It is a flexible and safe
          delivery method.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend using [<code>displayName</code>] from the shipping guide
          as the delivery option title.

        <h3>4 Choose pickup location</h3>
        <p>
          If user select package to pickup point, best practice is to expand and
          show a drop down list for pickup points. See illustration of open
          dropdown for pickup points; The drop down should display 5-7 nearest
          pickup points. An additional best practice is to allow the user to
          search based on a postal code, as some users might want to pick up
          their package in a different location than near their home.
        </p>
        <b>Package box </b>
        <p>
          If user choose package box (Type 37), let the user know that they need
          Posten app, and if the package is too big it will go to nearest pickup
          point. Package box can be identified by PickupPointType = Type 37
