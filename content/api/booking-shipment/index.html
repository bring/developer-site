  <h2 class="dev-anchored">Similarities and differences</h2>

  <p>
    Bring provides two different APIs for creating bookings, the
    <a href="/api/booking/">Booking API</a> and the
    <a href="/api/shipment/">Shipment API</a>. These APIs have similarities, but
    there are also differences.
  </p>
  <p>
    In overall you can think of the Shipment API as an API corresponding to EDI.
    It supports a complete portfolio of services and value added services. You
    will not get labels created, and it does not use strict input validation.
    Orders are created much in the same way as with EDI, and you will not get
    them fully integrated in Mybring.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Booking API is a part of Mybring, so the API support is closely
    connected to the booking functionality you find in the web interface. The
    API supports standard services, as in Mybring, and you have the same set of
    input validation as on web. Labels will be created, and you will find the
    API orders in order history; together with the web orders.
