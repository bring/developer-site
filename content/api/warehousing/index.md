introduction:
  The Warehousing API is used to submit order and article information to Bringâ€™s warehouses. Users are also able to extract/subscribe for detailed order information from our warehouses while the orders are being processed. Further, the API provides information about articles in stock, with methods for retrieving information about single items or configurable list of items.
