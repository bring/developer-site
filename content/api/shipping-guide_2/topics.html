  <h2>No applicable services found</h2>
  <p>
    When no services are applicable for the requested you've made an empty
    resultset is returned. Reasons can be that the shipment was too large or too
    small, or the requested shipment was outside the coverage area of the
    requested services. Your code should handle these cases, i.e. an empty
    result, and should not fail because of this.
  </p>
  <p>
    How can I fix this? You could e.g. use a Cargo product when you want to send
    large shipments, or you could request other services and see which ones that
    fits your need and find your service by using
    <a href="https://www.bring.no/english/sending"
      >What would you like to send?</a

  <h2>Trace messages</h2>
  <p>
    Trace messages are meant as debug messages to the developer and are
    <strong>not intended to be parsed by the application</strong>. Parsing the
    trace messages may result in unexpected behaviour since they may change. The
    new Shipping Guide endpoint supports structured errors so it shouldn't be
    necessary to parse trace messages, but if you see the need feel free to
    contact us.

  <h2>Volume, weight, dimensions and loading meter</h2>
  <p>
    Shipping Guide use measurement of the package to calculate price of the
    Shipment. Shipping Guide accept measurements in <code>Volume</code>,
    <code>Weight </code>and <code>Dimensions(Length, Width and Height)</code>.
    Either <code>Volume</code> or <code>Weight</code> or
    <code>Dimensions</code> must be present in the request. It is recommended to
    request Shipping Guide with accurate measurements to get most precise price.
    Apart from these measurements, <code>Loading meter </code> is a kind of
    measurement which can be sent in the request for CARGO services to get more
    precise price information.

<section class="dev-docscontent__section">
  <h2>Pre-registered - EDI</h2>
  <p>
    It is possible to tell the Shipping Guide API that your parcel is registered
    using EDI when it is shipped, there is a parameter <code>edi</code> for
    that. Using this parameter may limit the available services and affect the
    price of others.

  <h2>Holidays and Home Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    There is no home delivery on bank holidays. It can also happen that Bring
    will not do home delivery on certain days during Christmas or Easter. The
    services will not take this into account. This must be handled by clients.
    End-users should not get delivery dates for holidays.
  </p>

  <h2>More than one customer number with JSON</h2>
  <p>
    Now we can request for multiple
    services with multiple customer number in single REST request similar to
    that SOAP version. Way this has been made possible is to send product along
    with API customer number delimited with <i>:</i>. More details can be found in the section
    <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#get-shipment-prices-and-estimated-delivery"
      >Get shipment prices and estimated delivery</a
    >

<section class="dev-docscontent__section">
  <h2>Adjusting prices</h2>
  <p>
    We do not support price adjustments in the Shipping Guide API. The pricing model
    is very simple now. It should be very easy to do price adjustment at client
    side.

  <h2 class="dev-anchored">Should I handle warnings?</h2>
  <p>
    Ideally clients should not parse these warning codes for any logic as they
    are bound to change. These are supposed to be treated as informational data.
    Warnings are sent out when Shipping guide is able to validate the
    request but missed some part of response for example Price or lead time due
    to unavailability of external systems. Ideally clients should not parse
    these warning codes for any logic as they are bound to change. These are
    supposed to be treated as informational data. Warning codes are documented
    in
    <a href="https://api.bring.com/shippingguide/api/ws/shipping-guide-20.xsd"
    >xsd</a
    >
    as well.

  <h2>HTTP status codes in JSON interface</h2>
  <p>
    The JSON interface uses
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes"
      >HTTP status codes</a
    >
    to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
  </p>
  <p>Here are some codes with added context :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      400 - Bad Request. If request parameters are bad, or any of the mandatory
      request parameters is missing.
    </li>
    <li>
      401 - Unauthorised request. If user has not sent Mybring authentication
      header or invaild X-MyBring-API-Uid/X-Mybring-API-Key
    </li>
    <li>
      404 - If the request doesn't come from API domain URL (api.bring.com).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Additional service XXX is not applicable for product YYY</h2>
  <p>
    If a requested additional service is not supported on requested product, API
    will just ignore that additional service for price calculation and return
    info as a trace message. Supported list of value added services on services
    can be found in the section <a href="/api/services/#additional-services">Value added Services</a>.
  </p>

<section class="dev-docscontent__section">
  <h2>Multiple packages (kolli) on rest endpoint</h2>
  <p>
    The package parameters supports postfixed indexes to differentiate different
    packages.
  </p>

  <p>The supported parameters are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>width</li>
    <li>height</li>
    <li>length</li>
    <li>weight</li>
    <li>volumeindm3</li>
    <li>volumespecial</li>
    <li>nonstackable</li>
    <li>numberofpallets</li>
    <li>loadingmeter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To specify weight for two different packages or kolli you can query like
    this: <code>weight0=200&weight1=250</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A parameter without an index is the same as the zero index</strong
    ><br />
    Meaning <code>weight0=200</code> and <code>weight=200</code> is specifying
    weight for the same package.
