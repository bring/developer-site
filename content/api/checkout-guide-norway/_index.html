      To provide your customers with the best possible shopping experience in
      your e-commerce store, we recommend displaying relevant delivery
      information at checkout. Based on user research and testing, we have
      developed a best practice for presenting the most common B2C delivery
      methods in a webshop checkout. Our recommended e-commerce delivery
      services are:
    </p>

    <ul class="text-heading">
      <li><a href='{{< relref "mailbox-parcel" >}}'>Mailbox parcel</a></li>
      <li><a href='{{< relref "home-delivery" >}}'>Home delivery</a></li>
      <li><a href='{{< relref "pickup-parcel" >}}'>Pickup parcel</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By offering these delivery options with additional services, your customers
      are able to select the delivery method best suited their needs. The best
      practice examples can be populated by using the
      <a href="../shipping-guide_2">Shipping Guide 2.0</a> and
      <a href="../pickup-point">Pickup Point</a> APIs.

        <h3>1 Postal code</h3>
        <p>
          To get a more precise estimated time of arrival and relevant pickup
          locations, customers need to enter postal code. If you use our API,
          you will get validation and city for the field.

      <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
        <h3>2 Street address</h3>
        <p>
          Some postal areas are split into multiple delivery zones, which
          impacts the delivery estimates. For the services Home Delivery and
          Optional Pickup Point to work properly, customers must enter their
          street address. The delivery options should have an overlay prompting
          the users to enter postal code and street address. This will be
          removed when both are provided.

        <h3>4 Price</h3>
        <p>
          We recommend offering a fixed shipping price on all delivery options
          in your store. Subsidized or free freight is one of the most powerful
          tools for increasing conversion. Subsidize all shipping methods
          equally so that the customers can pick the shipping method that best
          fits their needs, without price incentives outweighing a particular
          shipping method.

          when all additional services are offered.

        <h3>7 Logo</h3>
        <p>
          Customers prefer to know what transporter the webshop uses. Use the
          Posten logo for B2C shops and Bring logo for B2B shops.
        </p>

      <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
        <h3>8 Estimated time of arrival</h3>
        <p>
          Let your customers know when their package will arrive, and you are
          relieving them of one of the biggest pains of online shopping.
          Therefore, it is best practice to always show an estimate for when the
          customer can expect their package. How it should be displayed depends
          on if the address is known, the delivery option and the additional
          services you offer. See each service to get more details.
