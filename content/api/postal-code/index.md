introduction: |
  The Postal Code API can be used for:
  * postal code validation
  * getting postal code suggestions from prefix based searches
  * fetching postal code details, including city, municipality and county details
  * fetching a list of all valid postal codes for supported countries

  For Norwegian, Danish and Finnish postal codes, itâ€™s also possible to get the postal code type, e.g. normal or post office box.

information:

      Clients exceeding 120 requests per second will be throttled, and the response will contain http status code 429. If you have a use case requiring rates above the limit, please contact developer-booking@bring.com for assistance.
