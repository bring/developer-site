  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      With the Postal Code API you can

      * validate a postal code
      * look up the city of a postal code
      * get the postal code type, e.g. normal or P.O. Box (for Norway)
      * list all valid postal codes for supported countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland)

      The API has two interfaces: XML and JSON.

  - title: Authentication
    content: |
      To make API requests, you will need an API key from Mybring. Steps for getting a key and description of headers can be found on the general API [Getting Started / Authentication](/api/#authentication) page.

  - title: Rate limiting
    content: |
      There is a rate limit defined that will start throttling requests generated by your client to this API if the number of requests per second exceeds 60. When rate limiting occurs, the response will contain Http status code 429. If you have a use case requiring rates exceeding the limit, please contact developer-booking@bring.com for assistance.

  - title: Supported Countries
    content: |
      The following countries are supported:

      * NO - Norway
      * DK - Denmark
      * SE - Sweden
      * FI - Finland
      * NL - Netherlands
      * DE - Germany
      * US - United States
      * BE - Belgium
      * FO - Faroe Islands
      * GL - Greenland
      * IS - Iceland

      The service uses [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) as source for most countries except Norway.

      For unsupported countries (countries not in the list above), all postal codes will be marked as valid with no city name returned. In these cases it is recommended to prompt the user to input the city name themselves.

      For countries that have multiple results (cities) for a given postal code, a list of cities will be returned. See example below.

      ### Postal Code type for Norway

      For Norway, you also get information about the postal code type. This is set in the `postalCodeType` in the response:

      | postalCodeType | Description |
      |:-----------------|:------------|
      | NORMAL | Normal postal code suitable for delivering packages. Contains street addresses or mix of street and other postal code types. |
      | PO_BOX | Postal code contains only P.O. Box addresses. Only certain Bring services can be delivered to these addresses (see the [Shipping Guide](/api/shipping-guide_2/)). |
      | SPECIAL_CUSTOMER | Special, e.g special return postal codes for selected customers. |
      | UNKNOWN | Unknown postal code type. Used for e.g. international postal codes. |

  - title: Support CORS
    content: |
      CORS headers will be added to response only for authenticated requests.
