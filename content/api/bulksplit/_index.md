  introduction: |
    The Bulksplit API provides an API for reserving CMR IDs. These CMR IDs
    can then be provided when booking individual shipments in order to connect
    them to the bulk shipment. When a bulk shipment is ready this API can then
    be used to order collection which will produce a waybill and routing
    labels for each of the registered pallets (or other load carriers).

  information:

    - title: Workflow
      content: |
        When working with the Bulksplit API the process is as follows:

        ### 1. Reserve a CMR ID

        Use the `/bulk-shipment-ids` endpoint to reserve an identifier for use on the CMR documentation and identifies the bulk shipment.

        ### 2. Book the shipping for the individual parcels/letters contained in the bulk shipment

        Using the [booking-api](../booking) book shipping for the individual parcels or letters contained in this bulk shipment placing the reserved CMR ID into the `consignments[0].references.consolidatedShipmentId` field.
        
        ### 3. Register the bulk-shipment and produce labels

        Use the `/bulk-shipments/{bulk-shipment-id}` endpoint to register the bulk-shipment providing all the necessary metadata to fill out the Waybill and Routing labels for each of the pallets, the API response contains links to the PDF
        representation of these labels.
