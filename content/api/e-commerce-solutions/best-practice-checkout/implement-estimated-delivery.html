    <p class="text-heading">
      By showing an estimated time of delivery, you are answering one of the
      most common questions customers shopping online are asking: when will my
      order arrive?
    </p>
    <p class="text-heading">
      There are a few things you need to bear in mind when setting this up:
    </p>

    <div class="message--warn maxw40r pam mvl">
      Your internal lead time is vital for a correct estimated delivery time
    </div>

    <h2 class="mbm screen-reader-text">Guide</h2>
    <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs maxw48r">
      <p>
        To use the lead times you receive from our APIs, you need to account for
        your own lead times as well and add them to the query as the shipping
        <code>date</code> and <code>time</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not provide the date and time for shipment handover to Bring
        when querying the Shipping Guide API, the response will assume the query
        time stamp is the shipment handover. E.g.: <code>date</code> = current
        date and <code>time</code> = current time stamp - the result will be an
        overly optimistic ETA in checkout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calculate your your shipping date and time <em>before</em> querying
        Shipping Guide.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="dev-guide-l flex flex-wrap-reverse">
      <div class="maxw48r flex-1">
        <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
          <h3>1&nbsp;Order&nbsp;placed before cut-off time</h3>
          <p>
            In the first case, the query to shipping guide will use today as
            shipping <code>date</code>, and 21:00 or blank as shipping
            <code>time</code>. A typical Bring lead time for packages to larger
            cities is one day, and the end user will be shown "tomorrow" as
            their delivery estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cut-off time can also be shown to the end user, both for providing
            transparency into what they can expect, and how they can benefit
            from ordering now, instead of later.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-green1 pal pbm mbxs">
          <h3>2 Order placed after cut-off time</h3>
          <p>
            In the second example, the same webshop gets an order at 19:17.
            Orders placed after 17:00 will not be packed in time for the pickup
            the same day. They do not need to be prioritised in the warehouse,
            and will be picked the next day. An additional day is added to the
            webshop lead time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, the query will set <code>date</code> = tomorrow’s
            date. With the same Bring distribution lead time, the end user will
            be shown "2 days" as their delivery estimate.

      <h3>Internal lead time as min-max values</h3>
      <p>
        While we recommend having as precise estimated delivery time as
        possible, we understand that sometimes, a range is needed to account for
        uncertainties or large volumes. By configuring internal lead time from
        minimum to maximum, you get this flexibility.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the value for both minimum and maximum lead time
          <em>is equal</em>, (e.g.: 0–0 days) you are able to present an
          <em>exact estimated delivery date</em> in checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the value for minimum and maximum lead time
          <em>differ</em> (e.g.: 1–2 days), you should provide the user with
          <em>a range instead of exact date</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For exact date, use the <code>expectedDeliveryDate</code> response from
        shipping guide, for a range, use <code>workingDays</code>.
