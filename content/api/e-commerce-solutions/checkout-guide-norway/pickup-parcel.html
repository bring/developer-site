        <h3>1 Delivery option Pakke til hentested</h3>
        <p>
          With more than 1700 pickup point locations across Norway, and an
          increasing number of package boxes being placed around the country
          (3000 will be in service by the end of 2021), your customers have a
          wide range of options for where to pick up their package. It is a
          flexible and safe delivery method.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend using [<code>displayName</code>] from the shipping guide
          as the delivery option label.

        <h3>2 Estimated delivery</h3>
        <p>
          Estimated delivery is the combination of your internal lead time and
          Posten / Bring lead time. For delivery to pickup point, estimated time
          is available in addition to the estimated date.

          You have some options for presentation depending on your shipping

        <h3>4 Choose pickup location</h3>
        <p>
          If the user selects Pickup point parcel, the best practice is to
          expand and show a drop down list for pickup points. See the
          illustration of the dropdown for pickup points, it should display 5–7
          closest pickup points. An additional best practice is to allow the
          user to search based on a postal code, as some users might want to
          pick up their package in a different location than near their home.
        </p>
        <h4>Query with area code <em>and</em> street address</h4>
        <p>
          We recommend querying the pickup point API with both area code and
          full street address to ensure that the returned pickup locations are
          the most relevant for the end user. A query with only area code will
          get pickup locations based on the geographic center point of the area.
        </p>
        <h4>Package box</h4>
        <p>
          If the user choose package box (Type 37), let them know that they need
          the Posten app, and if the package is too big it will go to nearest
          pickup point. Package box can be identified by
          <code>PickupPointType</code> = Type 37
