  <h3 class="text-heading">Delivery attempts</h3>
  <p>If a sender want their package delivered to the door, and it cannot be delivered (i.e. Business closed or recipient is not present), then you can now choose what will happen with your package.</p>
  <p>This is controlled by the <code>deliveryOption</code> element/attribute</p>
  <p>If you want Bring to attempt delivery only once and/or deliver package to nearest PiB, then you must tell us by setting this option. These options cost extra money but the customer/sender will only be charged if the event happen.</p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>You send a package to a business with the <code>deliveryOption=ONE_DELIVERY_THEN_PIB</code>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If Bring manage to deliver the package to the recipient on first try, then no extra charges is made.</li>
    <li>If first attempt to deliver fails, then the package will be delivered to nearest PiB. The customer/sender will be charged extra.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Possible options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>ONE_DELIVERY_THEN_PIB</code></li>
    <li><code>TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_PIB</code></li>
    <li><code>TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_RETURN</code></li>
  </ul>
