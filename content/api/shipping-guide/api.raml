- title: Introduction
  content: |
      The Shipping Guide (Fraktguiden) is a free service from Bring that provides

      * price information,
      * service area (norwegian: dekningsområde), and
      * estimated delivery times.

      With the Shipping Guide it is easy to offer different shipping alternatives to your end customers. Whether they want to

      * get delivery to the door (daytime or evening),
      * pick up the shipment at a post office, or
      * get the shipment delivered to the mailbox

      The Shipping Guide returns the recommended way to present these shipping alternatives, as well as prices and delivery times.

      [Demo shipping alternatives](/shipping-guide/demo).

      The demo shows that the Shipping Guide returns service categories for each request, making a shipping alternatives-page easy to set up. The focus is on delivery methods to the end customer, not service names.

      The Shipping Guide has several interfaces (SOAP and XML/JSON). Choose the option that fits your needs best (see table below). The SOAP interface is the core interface with complete functionality. There are some limitations in the XML/JSON API, such as the inability to mark a parcel as a specialized goods.

      There is also a [Offline SOAP service](#offline-data) for retrieving data for offline use (get complete prices, service area and delivery times based on a fixed sender postal code).

- title: Available services
  content: |
    The Shipping Guide API has a lot of various services and value added services. So many, in fact, that we decided to document them in a separate page.

    [See the whole list of services and value added services here.](/api/services/#shipping-guide)

- title: General Guidelines
  content: |
      ### VAT

      Shipping Guide specifies VAT related to senders country. It's up to the client to decide if VAT is applicable to their situation of sale.

      ### Value added services affecting price

      Make sure you specify the correct value added services for a package when querying the Shipping Guide.

      Especially the `evarsling` value added service for the Servicepakke service (recipient notification over SMS or E-Mail) will affect the base package price returned from the Shipping Guide, and should therefore be set according to what will be sent in the actual EDI message.

      If `evarsling` is not specified in the request, Fraktguiden will from 2013-01-01 add a fee for paper based recipient notification to the base package price for Servicepakke. As of 2013-01-01 the fee is NOK 4,-

- title: Error Handling Guidelines
  content: |
      When using the Shipping Guide, it is important to handle errors gracefully. Your web shop's users should still be able to order, even if the Shipping Guide returns an error or a timeout occurs.

      ### No services applicable

      If there are no services applicable for the requested shipment, an empty resultset will be returned. This means that for the passed-in service list, no services can be used for the shipment. Either the shipment is too large or is outside of the coverage area of all the requested services. Your code should handle this case, i.e. an empty service list for the shipment.

      One suggestion is to include more services in each request, e.g. a Cargo-service to handle large shipments. You should know how to send Cargo services before including it though.


      ### General errors

      When using the Shipping Guide, errors or service unavailability can occur, although we do our utmost to prevent any downtime. Thus it is important to use timeouts and other error handling techniques when making requests to the service.

      How you handle errors depends on the nature of your application, but one strategy for handling such situations is by providing a failover if the shipping guide responds with an error or does not respond at all (timeout).

      For instance your application can respond to an error by using prefetched [offline data](#offline-data) to calculate prices and delivery time estimates. Another alternative would be to use a a fixed standard price whenever an error occurs.

- title: Offline data
  content: |
    Offline data lets you download a failover version of the data from the Shipping Guide.

    By using the Offline Data Web Service (see [WSDL](#soap)) or [Offline Data form](/shipping-guide/offline) you can download price lists, transport times and value added services designed for offline usage. Offline data is suitable as a failover solution if the Shipping Guide does not respond or responds with an error message, or if there are extreme demands on performance.

    *Important!* With offline data, you have to deal with all the rules of special goods, shipping calculated weight (volume weight), and more. These rules are located on the respective service pages on bring.com. Remember to update the database at price changes!

    The service is available free of charge, provided acceptance of the terms of use. Note that only registered users will receive notifications of changes in service!

    For those who use the offline data, we recommend to get the updates automatically via Offline Data Web Service.

    #### Useful XPaths when processing offline data

    Get Price Zone (returns an empty answer if toPostalCode is outside the coverage area for the chosen service):

        //Product[@productId='SERVICEPAKKE']//PriceZone[@toPostalCode='2000']/text()

    Get Price based on Price Zone "2":

        //Product[@productId="SERVICEPAKKE"]//Price[@priceZone="2" and @weight="4000"]/text()

    Get transport time (older versions):

        //Product[@productId='SERVICEPAKKE']//WorkingDays[@toPostalCode="2000"]/text()

    Get transport time (version 11):

        //Product[@productId='SERVICEPAKKE']//ExpectedDeliveryTime[@toPostalCode="2000"]/WorkingDays/text()

    If you are a Mybring user, you can [authenticate](/api/#authentication) requests to the Shipping Guide. Authenticated requests have the following benefits:

    - Agreement prices
    - Prices for value added services
    - Lead time
    - Coverage

    Agreement prices are supported for all services except for Mail, Express and Courier Long Distance services. Fixing this is on our todo list, though.

          For a given shipment from A to B, the core way to use the Shipping Guide is to query for all the services you know how to send (e.g. the services you have a customer agreement for). From that given set of services specified in the request, the Shipping Guide will return the services that are relevant for the shipment, based on service attributes (e.g. max package size and weight) and service area (norwegian: dekningsområde), e.g. not all services are offered to all postal codes.

          *Example:* You have a package of 2,5 kilos from postal codes 0484 to 5600 that you want to send. Your webshop knows how to send (e.g. has a customer agreement) for sending the following Bring services:

          * Servicepakke
          * Bedriftspakke
          * Bedriftspakke Ekspress - Over Natten
          * På Døren
          * Mail

          The Shipping Guide request should then be made for all the services (explicitly set using multiple service parameters), and the Shipping Guide will tell you which services are applicable. E.g. Mail is not applicable since the package is greater than 2 kg, and postal code 5600 is outside the service area for "På Døren".

          Request: [../all.json?clientUrl=insertYourClientUrlHere&weightInGrams=2500&from=0484&to=5600&product=servicepakke&product=bpakke_dor-dor&product=ekspress09&product=pa_doren&product=mail](https://api.bring.com/shippingguide/products/all.json?clientUrl=insertYourClientUrlHere&weightInGrams=2500&from=0484&to=5600&product=servicepakke&product=bpakke_dor-dor&product=ekspress09&product=pa_doren&product=mail)

/api/ws:
  displayName: SOAP
  description: |
      The web service interface offers the most options when performing queries to the Shipping Guide.

      Note that to use the SOAP service, you have to [authenticate the requests](/api/#authentication).

      ### WSDL

      WSDL / schema versions: [11](https://api.bring.com/shippingguide/api/ws/fraktguide-v11.wsdl). The current version is 11.

      [Fraktguide XML Schema documentation](https://api.bring.com/shippingguide/api/ws/schema-latest.xsd)

      ### Versioning

      The Shipping Guide makes an effort to always be backwards compatible regarding data format for requests and responses of the Web Service. To achieve this, a `SchemaVersion` element is used in the request, indicating which version the client is on and what data-format the client expects in the result.

      *Important*: All clients must accept new (unknown) elements in the response. E.g. unknown elements should be ignored. The client framework used by client must not crash when unknown elements are encountered.

      When incompatible changes in the schema are made (other than addition of new elements), the SchemaVersion is incremented by one. The new schema is used at the *same endpoint URL* as before and uses the same namespace for its XML elements. A TraceMessage element (info message) in the response is added to inform the client that its schema should be updated. Old schema versions might in the future be unsupported.

      Regarding the XML/JSON API (not Web Services), an XML Schema is not used at all. Clients of the XML/JSON API are expected to handle new elements that appear. Nevertheless, the response will be backwards compatible in the sense that elements are not renamed.

      ### Holidays and Home Delivery

      There is no home delivery on bank holidays. It can also happen that Bring will not do home delivery on certain days during Christmas or Easter.

      The service will not take this into account. This must be handled by clients. End-users should not get delivery dates for holidays.
