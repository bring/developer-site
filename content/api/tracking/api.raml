documentation:
- title: Introduction
  content: |
      The Tracking API provides the opportunity to track shipments by reference, package or shipment number.
      It is an easy way to display details and the status of shipments.
      The information available in this API is the same that is publically available from the [Tracking web site](http://tracking.bring.com/).

- title: Versioning
  content: |
    Latest Tracking API version: `v2`

    We encourage you to use the latest version of our API all time.  Of course, we keep the previous version for some time so that you will get enough time to convert your application. This API supports versioning by two means.

    ### Select version by request-header
    Use the normal URL but add the following request-header:

    | Header | Example |
    |:-------|:--------|
    | `api-version` | `2` |

    #### Example request
    ```
    curl -H "api-version: 2" https://tracking.bring.com/api/tracking.json?q=TESTPACKAGE-AT-PICKUPPOINT
    ```

    ### Select version by URL
    Use the normal URL, but add **```{v1, v2}```** to the URL. Example:

    | Application | URL example |
    |:-------|:--------|
    | Open tracking | https://tracking.bring.com/api/**v2**/tracking.json?q=TESTPACKAGE-AT-PICKUPPOINT |
    | Logged-in tracking | https://api.bring.com/tracking/api/**v2**/tracking.json?q=TESTPACKAGE-AT-PICKUPPOINT |

    You can verify that your request were used correctly by certifying that the response contains an element based on the request type:

    | URI request | Response type | Example |
    |:-------|:--------|:--------|
    | tracking.json | `application/json; charset=utf-8` | `{"apiVersion": "2"}` |
    | tracking.xml | `application/xml;charset=utf-8` | `<ApiVersion>2</ApiVersion>` |

    #### Example request
    ```
    curl -v https://tracking.bring.com/api/v2/tracking.json?q=TESTPACKAGE-AT-PICKUPPOINT
    ```

- title: Authentication
  content: |
    If you have a Mybring user, you can perform authenticated requests. They have the following benefits:
    - More information about parcels:
      - Price
      - Name
      - Address
      - Signatures for proof of delivery
    - Less strict rate limits

    To make authenticated Tracking API requests, you will have to use the endpoint [https://api.bring.com/tracking/api/](https://api.bring.com/tracking/api/). You also need an API key from Mybring. Steps for getting a key and description of headers can be found on the general API [Getting Started / Authentication](/api/#authentication) page.


- title: Formats
  content: |
    The Tracking API generates the following formats:
    - ```XML```
    - ```JSON```
    - ```JSONP```

- title: JSON API
  content: |
      We follow the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) with one
      exception: we allow media type to be specified as `application/json`
      instead of `application/vnd.api+json`.

        description: |
          For testing you can use "TESTPACKAGE-AT-PICKUPPOINT" as the tracking number to generate test results. For real tracking this must be a valid number.

          You can find an XSD for the XML response here: [tracking-v2.xsd](https://tracking.bring.com/schema/api/tracking-v2.xsd).

          A parcel has a number of events connected to it during its travel. Here are a list of current event statuses that can be returned.
