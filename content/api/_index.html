  <p class="text-heading fw600 mbl">
    Authentication is required by all APIs, that means having a Mybring user
    account with an API key. Authorisation is required by some APIs, that means
    having a customer number and certain rights connected to the user. The
    following describes how the requirements work together and how to obtain
    them.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="api-customer-number">Customer number</h2>
  <p>
    In order to use the majority of our APIs, your company needs to be a Bring
    customer and have a customer number. While most customers have only one
    number, many also choose to have multiple numbers when they need to separate
    departments or subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the API you want to use requires a customer number and you don’t have one
    yet, contact customer support via your country’s Bring site.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need a customer number for testing purposes, it can be found in the
    <a href='{{< relref "testing" >}}'>API testing documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="user">Mybring user account</h2>
  <p>
    You need a personal Mybring user account to work with the Bring API’s. If
    you don’t have one already,
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user"
      >register a new account</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="access">Customer number access</h3>
  <p>
    You can see the customer numbers your account has access to on the
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api"
      >Mybring API page</a
    >. If the customer number you are looking for isn’t listed, you can get
    access to it through one of the following methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Go to the
      <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/profile/authorisation"
        >Mybring authorisation page</a
      >, search for the customer number and apply for access.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contact your customer’s administrator and get them to connect your user.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You might work with multiple companies and each of these companies might
    have multiple customer numbers in Bring. You can use the same Mybring user
    for different companies.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="rights">User rights</h3>
  <p>
    Rights control what the user can do, for instance order certain services on
    behalf of the company or see certain information about it. While one user
    can have access to many different customers, the rights are specific for
    each customer number. The company adminstrator controls the accesses and
    rights within a company and the user can apply for them in the
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/profile/authorisation"
      >Mybring authorisation page</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="api-key">API Key</h3>
  <p>
    When you have a Mybring user, you can create an API-key. The key is
    necessary for authentication and is unique to your user account. It’s used
    together with the user account email address when connecting to the APIs.
    The same key is used for all APIs and all Bring customer numbers the user
    has access to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be aware that if you chose to change or delete the API key or delete the
    entire user account, any integration using it will stop working and must be
    updated with a new key.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API key is created and managed in the
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api"
      >Mybring API page</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="authentication">Authentication headers</h2>
  <p>
    When you have the user account with the access, rights and API key, you are
    ready to connect to the APIs in either your own system or an API client.
    Each API has individual details, but the following three HTTP header
    parameters are always required.
  </p>
  <dl class="bg-gray2 rad-a2px pal maxw50r">
    <dt>X-Mybring-API-Uid</dt>
    <dd>The email address of your Mybring user account.</dd>
    <dd class="mbm">Example: <code>name@your-company-domain.com</code></dd>

    <dt>X-Mybring-API-Key</dt>
    <dd>The user account’s API key.</dd>
    <dd class="mbm">
      Example: <code>1234abc-abcd-1234-5678-abcd1234abcd</code>
    </dd>

    <dt>X-Bring-Client-URL</dt>
    <dd>The URL for the service where you are using the API.</dd>
    <dd>Example: <code>your-company-domain.com</code></dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="status-and-support">Status and support</h2>
  <p>
    We continuously monitor our APIs with health checks to measure uptime.
    Real-time and historical status can be found on the
    <a
      href="https://status.bring.systems"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >operational status page</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have trouble or questions regarding the different APIs, we actively
    use the comment sections on the respective API docs.
  </p>

<section class="dev-docscontent__section">
  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="formats">Formats</h2>
  <p>
    All our APIs are REST APIs supporting JSON and XML.

    <a class="nowrap" href="./order-management/">Order Management</a> and
