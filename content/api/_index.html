  <p class="text-1.25r fw600 mbl">
    All API connections require <em>authentication</em> via a Mybring user
    account with an API key. Some APIs also require <em>authorisation</em> to
    identify the Bring customer. The following describes how the requirements
    work together and how to fill them before connecting.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="user">1. User account</h2>
  <div class="startguide-item">
    <div>
      <p>
        If you don’t have a user already,
        <a href="https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user"
          >register a new account</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some like to have an account dedicated to API use, but it depends on you
        or your company’s needs. The account type is no different either way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have a Mybring user account, you must create an API key and
        give the user access to the customer number you want to make action on
        behalf of.
      </p>
    </div>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/images/getting-started/user.png"
        alt="Two inputs, a button and a user icon to signigy user account."
      />
      <figcaption>Register a user account in Mybring.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="api-key">2. API key</h2>
  <div class="startguide-item">
    <div>
      <p>
        The API key is created and managed on the
        <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api"
          >Mybring API page</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key is, like a password, unique to your user account. It’s used with
        the user account email address when connecting to the APIs.
      </p>
      <p class="message--warn pam">
        If you change or delete the API key or delete the entire user account,
        any integration using it will stop working and must be updated with a
        new key.
      </p>

  </div>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="api-customer-number">3. Customer number</h2>
  <div class="startguide-item">
    <div>
      <p>
        Your company or organisation needs to be a Bring customer and have a
        customer number to use the majority of our APIs. Requests use the number
        to identify, for instance, who to invoice or provide information about.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the API you want to use requires a customer number and the company or
        organisation doesn’t have one yet, contact customer support via your
        country’s Bring site.
      </p>
      <p>
        A customer number for testing purposes can be found in the
        <a href='{{< relref "testing" >}}'>API testing documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="access">User, number and rights</h3>
      <p>
        The user account makes API requests for customer numbers it has access
        to. Rights control what the user can do within a customer number, for
        instance, placing orders or accessing financial information.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see the accesses on the
        <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api"
          >Mybring API page</a
        >. If the customer number you are looking for isn’t listed, you can get
        access to it and acquire the necessary rights through one of the
        following methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Go to
          <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings"
            >Customer numbers and rights in Mybring</a
          >, search for the customer number and apply for access and rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact your administrator and get them to connect your user to the
          customer number and set the rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are an administrator, users access and rights to customer
          numbers can be managed in
          <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin-external/users"
            >Mybring’s user administration</a
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="message--info pam">
        Most companies have only one customer number, and most users have access
        to only one customer number. Still, having multiple numbers and accesses
        is possible. Rights are specific to each customer number.
      </p>

        src="/images/getting-started/customer.png"

      <figcaption>
        Companies have customer numbers. The user account is given certain
        rights within a customer number to make corresponding requests.

  <div class="startguide-item">
    <div>
      <p>
        When you have the user account and the API key, you can connect to the
        APIs through your system or an API client. Each API has additional
        details about individual requirements and procedures, but the following
        three HTTP header parameters are always required.
      </p>
      <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="authentication">Authentication headers</h3>
      <dl class="bg-gray2 rad-a2px pal maxw50r">

      <figcaption>
        All the prerequisites are used to make a request. The requests evaluate
        if the user account has the correct rights within the customer number
        before returning a response.
