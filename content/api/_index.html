<section class="dev-docscontent__section" aria-label="Connecting to the APIs">
  <p class="text-heading fw600 mbl">
    All API connections require <em>authentication</em> via a Mybring user
    account with an API key. Some APIs also require <em>authorisation</em> to
    identify the Bring customer. The following describes how the requirements
    work together and how to fill them before connecting.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="user">User account and API key</h2>
  <p>
    You need a personal Mybring user account and an API key to connect to the
    Bring APIs. If you don’t have a user already,
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user"
      >register a new account</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have a Mybring user, you must create an API key. The key is, like a
    password, unique to your user account. It’s used with the user account email
    address when connecting to the APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API key is created and managed on the
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api"
      >Mybring API page</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p class="message--warn pam">
    If you change or delete the API key or delete the entire user account, any
    integration using it will stop working and must be updated with a new key.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="api-customer-number">Customer number</h2>
  <p>
    Your company or organisation needs to be a Bring customer and have a
    customer number to use the majority of our APIs. Requests use the number to
    identify, for instance, who to invoice or provide information about.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the API you want to use requires a customer number and the company or
    organisation doesn’t have one yet, contact customer support via your
    country’s Bring site.
  </p>
  <p>
    A customer number for testing purposes can be found in the
    <a href='{{< relref "testing" >}}'>API testing documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="access">User and number</h3>
  <p>
    The user account makes API requests for customer numbers it has access to.
    You can see your accesses on the
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api"
      >Mybring API page</a
    >. If the customer number you are looking for isn’t listed, you can get
    access to it through one of the following methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Go to
      <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings"
        >Customer numbers and rights in Mybring</a
      >, search for the customer number and apply for access.
    </li>
    <li>Contact your administrator and get them to connect your user.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most customers have only one customer number, and most users have access to
    only one customer number. Still, having multiple numbers and accesses is
    possible. The user account uses the same key for all customer numbers it has
    access to.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="rights">Rights and number</h3>
  <p>
    Rights control what the user can do within a customer number, for instance,
    placing orders or accessing financial information. The rights are specific
    to each customer number. The user can apply for
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings"
      >customer numbers access and rights in Mybring</a
    >, and the company administrator manages the requests.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dev-anchored" id="connecting">Connect to the APIs</h2>
  <p>
    When you have the user account and the API key, you can connect to the APIs
    through your system or an API client. Each API has additional details about
    individual requirements and procedures, but the following three HTTP header
    parameters are always required.
  </p>
  <h3 class="dev-anchored" id="authentication">Authentication headers</h3>
