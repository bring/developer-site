## Pickup Point API for Svalbard postal codes with country code SJ

Svalbard & Jan Mayen pickup points are registered under country code NO. When requesting pickup points for the official Svalbard country code (SJ), the API used to return unsupported country. This is fixed, so going forward Svalbard and Jan Mayen postal codes should be available via both Norwegian and Svalbard country codes NO/SJ in pickuppoint API.
