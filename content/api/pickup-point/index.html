<div class="message--success maxw48r pam mbl">
  <strong
  >Max parcel dimensions for Pakkeboks (parcel lockers in Norway) pickup points</strong
  >
  <br /><br />
  We're now returning max parcel dimensions for Pakkeboks pickup points.
  This can be used to filter out pickup points based on parcel size on the client side, and thus preventing failed bookings during checkout due to exceeding the max parcel locker size.
  The field looks like this (JSON):
  <br />
  <code>
    "maxParcelDimensions": {
      "length": 44.5,
      "width": 50.5,
      "height": 60.0
  }
  </code>
  <br />
</div>
