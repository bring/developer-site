On September 1, Bring is decommissioning the service Return mailbox parcel (9650). 

We strongly recommend transitioning to start using alternative return services in Norway (9350, 9300) as soon as possible, as booking of 9650 will not be possible shortly after this date.

This is the case for both of the following scenarios:
- return bookings of 9650 
- combined outbound + return bookings of 3584 and 9650 together, using the `returnProduct` element
