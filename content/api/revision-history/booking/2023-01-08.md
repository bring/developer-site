Starting 1 February 2023, maximum weight for a pickup order for cargo shipments in Norway will be set to **9999 kg chargeable weight**. This limit corresponds to the existing chargeable weight limit for a groupage shipment. Shipments above 9999kg are handled as a door-to-door direct transport service (partload) and, hence, are not eligible for the pickup order service.
More information about our service terms and conditions can be found in our [Transport Guide](https://www.bring.no/tjenester/pakker-og-gods/Transportguiden_01122022.pdf)
