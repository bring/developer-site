The Booking API is getting more unique error codes.

Shortly, we'll add some more unique error codes in the area of parties validation. The new codes will be replacing the generic `BOOK-VALIDATION-001` code.
Work on improving the error codes is still ongoing, and the initial focus is on providing unique error codes for each failure scenario.
