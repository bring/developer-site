We are changing the api request format for in __Pickup Order__ for __pickupDetails__.
New Pickup Order request format uses `package` field, `pallet` field and `postContainer` field to give information on packages, pallets and postContainers.
Each of these has a `count` field, `weightInGrams` field  and `volumeInDm3` field.
Check [Order a pickup](/https://developer.bring.com/api/booking/#order-a-pickup-post) for request examples in json/xml. 

This enables weight and volume to be given on each goods item level, instead of as a total.
