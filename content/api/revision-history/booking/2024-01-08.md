We are changing the request format in __Pickup__ Order for __pickup details__.
New Pickup Order request format has a `package` field, `pallet` field and `postContainer` field.
Each of these has a `count` field, `weightInGrams` field  and `volumeInDm3` field.
Check Pickup Order api for request examples. 

This enables weight and volume to be given on each goods item level, instead of as a total.
