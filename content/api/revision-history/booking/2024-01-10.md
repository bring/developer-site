On January 10, 2024, we are changing the API request format for __pickupDetails__ in the __Pickup Order__ request.
The new Pickup Order request format uses the `package`, `pallet` and `postContainer` field to give information on packages, pallets and postContainers.
Each of these has a `count` field, `weightInGrams` field  and `volumeInDm3` field.
See [Order a pickup](https://developer.bring.com/api/booking/#order-a-pickup-post) for request examples in json/xml. 

This enables weight and volume to be given on each goods item level, instead of as a total.
