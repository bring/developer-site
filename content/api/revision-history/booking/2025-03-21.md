The Booking API has gotten a new structure for sending customs information. Along with this comes support for sending VOEC (VAT on E-commerce) on imports to Norway on some services.
The existing/old format is now deprecated, and will be phased out. See [this page](/api/booking/customs/) for more information on how to send such information when ordering a shipment.
