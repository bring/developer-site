For customers requesting environmental data in Shipping Guide API, a link to an environmental logo that can be used in checkout is now being returned in the `guiInformation` part of the response. Note that the `WithGuiInformation` field must therefore be set to true. The environmental data description text has also been extended to cover 5800 Pakke til hentested and 0340 Pickup Parcel/0342 Pickup Parcel Bulk when sent to Norway.
