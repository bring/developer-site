Migration from Buypass to Let’s Encrypt TLS Certificates
As of 15 September 2025, Buypass has stopped allowing registration of new ACME Account and will stop generating/renewing TLS certificates from 15th October 2025. To ensure continuity, we are migrating all TLS certificates from Buypass to Let´s Encrypt.

As part of this activity:
* Old Buypass certificates will be removed
* New Let´s Encrypt certificates will be created

Impact to Customers:
* If your application does not pin the certificate, no action is required and there will be zero impact.
* If your application does pin the certificate, you will need to download the new Let´s Encrypt certificate and update your application configuration accordingly.

We recommend reviewing your applications to check whether certificate pinning is in place and preparing for updates if needed.
