Important Update: Migration from Buypass to Letâ€™s Encrypt TLS Certificates
As of 15 September 2025, Buypass has stopped allowing registration of new ACME Account and will stop generating/renewing TLS certificates from 15th October 2025. To ensure continuity, we are migrating all TLS certificates from Buypass to LetsEncrypt.
As part of this activity:
Old Buypass certificates will be removed from the terraform state (Buypass)
New LetsEncrypt certificates will be created

Impact to Customers:
If your application does not pin the certificate, no action is required and there will be zero impact.
If your application does pin the certificate, you will need to download the new LetsEncrypt certificate and update your application configuration accordingly.
This migration will be carried out in batches (due to LetsEncrypt rate limits) and will also cover certificates using the cert-share module.
We recommend reviewing your applications to check whether certificate pinning is in place and preparing for updates if needed.
