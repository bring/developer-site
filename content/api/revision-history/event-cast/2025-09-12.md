We have now launched an endpoint to get all webhooks belonging to the customers a user has access to. 
This endpoint is described on the [Event Cast API page](https://developer.bring.com/api/event-cast/), 
under get all webhooks on customer numbers a user has access to. These can also be seen in the Mybring portal by accessing
Profile and settings -> customer settings -> webhooks.
