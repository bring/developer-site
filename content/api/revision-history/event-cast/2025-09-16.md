Admin users can now moderate any webhook registered on their customer number. This includes viewing, renewing, and deleting webhooks created by themselves or other users.

To support this, we’ve introduced a new API endpoint that returns all registered webhooks associated with the customer numbers linked to the user making the request.
- Customer admin users will receive a list of all webhooks related to their customer number.
- Non-admin users will only see the webhooks they have created.

Webhook moderation is also available in the Mybring portal under: Profile and settings → Customer settings → Webhooks
