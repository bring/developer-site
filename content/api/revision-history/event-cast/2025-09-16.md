Customer admins can now moderate any webhook registered on their customer number. This includes viewing, renewing, and deleting webhooks created by other users.

To support this, we’ve:

- Introduced a new endpoint: Get All Webhooks Accessible by User (see [Event Cast API](https://developer.bring.com/api/event-cast/))
- Updated the renew and delete endpoints
- Made webhook moderation available in the Mybring portal under Profile and settings → Customer settings → Webhooks
