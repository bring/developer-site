Starting June 19, 2024, the Event Cast API will support subscriptions on customer numbers. This new feature complements the existing functionality to subscribe on shipment or parcel numbers and does not replace them.

With customer number subscriptions, youâ€™ll automatically receive updates for all shipments registered on that customer number, removing the need to manage individual subscriptions for each new shipment or parcel. These subscriptions will have a validity of one year.

To start using the new customer number subscription, please see to the updated [Event Cast API documentation](https://developer.bring.com/api/event-cast/).
