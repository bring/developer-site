For estimated arrival times for Norwegian parcels going to pickup points, it is now possible to get arrival date specific arrival times at pickup point when
requesting alternate delivery days. The number of expected working days is also returned. For arrival times at pickup points, the `ExpectedDelivery` response 
element normally used for lead time information is **not** returned. In stead a list of `EstimatedDeliveryTimes` is available.
