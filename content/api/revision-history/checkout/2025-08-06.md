On 15th August, we will be updating the [Postal Code API](/api/postal-code/#get-postal-codes-matching-query-get) to improve how postal code filtering is handled.

As part of this update, we are removing the po_box_only query parameter. Instead, we are introducing a new, more flexible query parameter - postal_code_type:

This new parameter allows filtering based on the type of postal code, using the following comma-separated values:
PO_BOX, STREET_ADDRESSES, COMBINED, SPECIAL_SERVICE

The response structure will remain unchanged â€” only the filtering mechanism is being improved.

If you currently use the po_box_only parameter, please update your integration to use postal_code_type before 8th August to ensure uninterrupted functionality.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need support with the migration.
