The SOAP endpoint is now deprecated. Going forward the API will only support `application/json` and `application/xml` 
as Content-Type.

If you are currently relying on the SOAP endpoint of Shipping Guide API, you have until ___1 March 2024___ to migrate
to the [JSON/XML over HTTP based endpoints](/api/shipping-guide_2/#fetch-shipping-details-post). 

We will start rate limiting requests to the SOAP endpoint from ___1 February 2024___, with gradually reduced
request rate until __1 March__. This means that you will risk rejected requests because of rate limiting after
__1 February__
