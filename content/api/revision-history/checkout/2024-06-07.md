In the coming weeks, we will be enhancing the service texts within the Shipping Guide API.

These updates relates to how the delivery options are described in checkout. The texts are updated with the latest information about each delivery option, and will be available in __Norwegian, Swedish, Danish__, and __English__.

We will update the text for the dynamic fields: `displayName`, `descriptionText`, `helpText`, and `shortName`. If you currently use these fields, no action is required. The structure and fields will remain unchanged; only the dynamic text will be updated.

For those not currently using these fields, we recommend utilize them to optimize your checkout. In the API, text related to delivery option will reflect the latest changes and ensuring that your customers receive accurate information about each delivery option.
