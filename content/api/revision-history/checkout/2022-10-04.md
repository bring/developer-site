The Same day delivery VAS (2012) allows shipments to be delivered same or next-day, depending on when the shipment is booked. By default, SG API returns the full service coverage area for Same day delivery. 

The "sortingAreas" tag allows the web shop to reduce the delivery area to the area they currently choose to provide the service. 

The "routeInformation" tag ontains information about the sorting area for a specific parcel. Intended use is to aid pre-sorting of same day parcels.
