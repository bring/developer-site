On 15 August, the po_box_only query parameter will be removed from the Postal Code API. 

It is replaced by a new, more flexible parameter: postal_code_type.
This new parameter allows filtering by postal code type using the following values: PO_BOX, STREET_ADDRESSES, COMBINED, SPECIAL_SERVICE.
The API response format remains unchanged.

If you currently use po_box_only, please update your integration to use postal_code_type by 15 August to ensure uninterrupted service.
