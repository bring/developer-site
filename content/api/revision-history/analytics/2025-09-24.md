Starting from October 2025, two new fields have been added to the invoice specification for parcels:

- "HandedInDate" (Handed in date) – the date the shipment was handed over to us
- "InvoiceTriggeredDate" (Invoice triggered date) – the date the shipment is considered delivered or made available to the customer, which in turn triggers the invoicing process. This date can also be found on the invoice PDF under “Order Period”
