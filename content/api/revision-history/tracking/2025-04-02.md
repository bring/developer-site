Starting Thursday, 24 April, the pickup code will be hidden in the Tracking API for senders. As the pickup code is considered personal information for the receiver, we are making this change to comply with GDPR regulations. If the pickup code is needed, the sender can use the Mybring Tracking portal to request the pickup code for each shipment. All such requests will be logged in a GDPR-compliant manner.
