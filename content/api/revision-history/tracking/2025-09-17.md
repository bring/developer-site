Starting Monday 22nd of September, the flex image will be hidden in the Tracking API. 
As the flex image is considered personal information, we are making this change to reduce 
risk of personal information being available in the Tracking API to be GDPR compliant. 
If the flex image is needed, the sender can use the Mybring Tracking portal to request 
the flex image for each shipment. All such requests will be logged in a GDPR-compliant manner.
