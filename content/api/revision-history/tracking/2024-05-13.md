Starting from May 13th, unauthenticated requests will no longer have access to the Tracking API. Previously, we implemented rate limiting measures.
Read [here](https://developer.bring.com/api) on how to make authenticated requests.

If you see following error message that means you are not sending authenticated requests.

``401 - Unathorized. The Tracking API no longer supports unauthenticated requests. Make sure your requests are authenticated. Read more about this on our Bring developer site. https://developer.bring.com/api/tracking/``
