Our customers are increasingly demanding new functionality and solutions that are easy to use. To meet these expectations, 
we must know which customers and partners are using our APIs and how they are using them. To further develop the value proposition of our Tracking API, 
the solution will require authentication. Read [here](https://developer.bring.com/api/tracking/) on how to make authenticated requests.

From 1 Aug 2023 , we will start rate liming the requests.

If you see following error message that means you are being rate limited, and you should start using authenticated requests.\

``Too many requests. We are now rate limiting our unauthenticated users, to prevent this make sure your requests are authenticated. Read more about this on our Bring developer site. https://developer.bring.com/api/tracking/``
