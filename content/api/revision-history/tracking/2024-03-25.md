We have discovered some API users exposing username and API key openly in the source code of their website.
This means that this information is accessible to anyone with a certain level of technical expertise.
This poses a security risk as it allows unauthorized access to information about agreements with Posten Bring,
as well as GDPR-sensitive customer data.

To address this, we strongly recommend that you call our Tracking API from the backend instead of via the browser.
This way, this information will not be exposed. We advise you to promptly delete the current API key and generate a new one here:
https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api

If it is not feasible to call our APIs from the backend and you are entirely dependent on doing so via the browser,
we recommend creating a new user account not associated with your customer numbers.
You can create such an account here: https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api

**Please note that starting from May 2, 2024, we will reject browser calls associated with a customer number to enhance security.**
