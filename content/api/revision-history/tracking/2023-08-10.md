From 15 August 2023, we will start rate liming the requests.

If you see following error message that means you are being rate limited, and you should start using authenticated requests.

``429 - Too many requests. We are now rate limiting our unauthenticated users, to prevent this make sure your requests are authenticated. Read more about this on our Bring developer site. https://developer.bring.com/api/tracking/``
