          <h1 class="api__title">Upgrading to version 2.0</h1>
          <p align="justify">This is a short summary of the differences between version 1.xx and 2.0 of the Shipping Guide API and will help
            you migrate to version 2.0 of the API.</p>
          <p align="justify">We recommend always updating to the latest version and to do it at your earliest convenience. Upgrading to
            the latest version maximizes the time between upgrades.</p>
          <p>The older 1.xx versions will become deprecated and shut down some time in the future.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="api__section">
          <h2>SOAP and JSON interface</h2>
          <h3>What we have changed</h3>
          <p align="justify">This section describes the main changes we have done to both the SOAP and the JSON interface</p>
          <h4>Authentication is mandatory</h4>

          <p align="justify">
            Authentication is mandatory. If we know you better, we will be in better position to notify you about new
            features in future and also about changes to API in general.
            It is similar to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/api/index#authentication/">authentication</a> process to what
            we had earlier.
            What is changed, we do not need to send X-Bring-Client-URL in headers now since you are already
            authenticated.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            If you are a new user, Signup <a href="https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user">here</a>.
            After login into Mybring, the API key will be generated by default. You will find your API key <a
            href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/">here</a>

            <br><br>
            <b>Note:</b> If you are already using Mybring authentication, same API key could be reused.
          </p>


          <h4 class="anchored">Restructured error response</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            In version 1 of the Shipping Guide API client and server error responses are mainly a HTML document
            describing what went wrong, but in some cases trace messages are used. In version 2.0 this is changed to be
            easier to parse. You can read more about the new format of the errors in <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#handle-api-errors">Handle
            API errors</a> and <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/topics/#should-i-handle-warnings">warnings.</a>
          </p>

          <h4 class="anchored">Introduced warnings</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            We have also introduced warnings on product level in Shipping guide response. Warnings are send out when Shipping guide is able to validate the request but
            missed some part of response for example Price or lead time due to unavailability of external systems.
            Ideally clients should not parse these warning codes for any logic as they are bound to change. These are supposed to be treated as informational data.
            Warning codes are documented in <a href="upgrade-to-version-2.html">xsd</a> as well.
          </p>

          <h4 class="anchored">Trace messages are disabled by default for SOAP</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            Trace messages are now disabled by default and will not be send out in response. If in case you explicitly need trace messages then it has to be passed explicitly in request.
          </p>

          <h4 class="anchored">Query params for REST endpoint</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            Some of the query params of <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#get-shipment-prices-and-estimated-delivery">REST</a> endpoint has slightly changed its name and they are not in camel case anymore. Meaning and functionality remains the same.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="api__section">
          <h2>SOAP interface</h2>
          <h3>What we have removed in Request</h3>
          <h4>Request properties</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            <code>WithPackageDetails</code> tag is no longer available, as we have discontinued package based shipping guide request.
          </p>

          <h4>Product IDs, Consignment and Packages tags</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            These tags are no longer available. From schema version 9, we introduced Consignments tag which consists of
            all of these tags.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            In shipping guide, every request can contain one or many consignments with shipments details, product ids,
            and package details (packages can be one or many).
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            So in Shipping guide 2.0, we have generalised it, and removed all the individual tags which are already part
            of Consignments tag.
          </p>

          <h4>Unit code for dimension in Consignments tag</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            unitCode is removed from the measurements LxWxH. The unit used is standard metric measurements units.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Length, width, and height can only be requested in centimeters
            </li>
            <li>
              Weight can only be requested in grams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Volume can only be requested in dm3.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Consignment tag in Consignments tag</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            This tag is just unwrapped, all the tags are still present, but not grouped. They are now part of the
            parent tag. Refer schema of Shipping Guide 2.0.
          </p>

          <h3>What we have changed in response</h3>
          <h4>ProductId</h4>
          <p align="justify"><code>ProductId</code> element is renamed to <code>Id</code>.</p>

          <h4>CustomerNumber</h4>
          <p align="justify"><code>CustomerNumber</code> attribute is changed to being an element.</p>
          <h4>ProductCodeInProductionSystem</h4>
          <p align="justify"><code>ProductCodeInProductionSystem</code>element is renamed to <code>ProductionCode</code>.</p>
          <h4>EDI information</h4>
          <p align="justify"><code>CourierSpecificEdiParameters</code>, <code>QuickpackSpecificEdiParametersType</code> and <code>UpsSpecificEdiParametersType</code> elements are grouped inside a <code>Edi</code> element and the names are shortened, i.e. "SpecificEdiParametersType" is removed from the names.</p>
          <h4>Price information</h4>
          <p align="justify"><code>Price</code> is renamed to <code>ListPrice</code> and that element, <code>NetPrice</code> and <code>PipSpecificPrice</code> are grouped inside a <code>Price</code> element.</p>
          <h3>What we have removed in Response</h3>

          <h4>Packages and Consignment response tags</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            These tags are removed for we don't support individual package level and consignment level requests anymore.
          </p>

          <h4>Consignments response tag</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            Trace messages and packages are removed, we have generalised a the response a lot, for better response
            format and parsing.
          </p>
          <h5>Products tag</h5>
          <p align="justify">
            This tag is has all the existing fields with few more added fields. Like Error and warning tags, for better
            error, handling.
            For more information, kindly refer the schema Shipping Guide 2.0
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="api__section">
          <h2>JSON interface</h2>

          <p align="justify">
            The overall response of all the three REST APIs is same, and conforms Shipping Guide 2.0 schema.
            So, response tags of REST API follow the previous section as well.
          </p>

          <h3>What we have removed</h3>
          <h4>Price adjustment</h4>
          <p align="justify">
            We do not support price adjustment in Shipping Guide 2.0. The pricing model is very simple now.
            It should be very easy to do price adjustment at client side.
