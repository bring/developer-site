title: Booking API
baseUri: https://api.bring.com/booking/api

documentation:
- title: Introduction
  content: |
      The Bring Booking API is a logged-in service that lets Mybring users (customers of Mybring) programatically create a booking by invoking a Web Service over SOAP or by posting XML/JSON over HTTP. The API uses the same backend as [Mybring Booking](https://www.mybring.com/booking/) and the same PDF labels.

      We support two types of integration with the Booking API. XML/JSON over HTTP and SOAP (over HTTP).

      Bring Booking uses Bring Fraktguide as the source for price and availability for the different products. We advise clients of the Booking API to use Fraktguiden for getting the list price and checking availability before sending a booking request. Note that invoice payment is the only available payment option for the Booking API. This means that the Mybring user ID used in the booking request must have access to the customer number specified as payer of the booking.

- title: Versioning strategy
  content: |
      Each request has a `schemaVersion` element indicating which release of the schema is being used in the request and expected schema format in the response. Important: All clients must accept new (unknown) elements in the response. E.g. unknown elements should be ignored. The client framework used by client must thus not crash when unknown elements are encountered. Note that this requirement excludes the (old, but still widely used) Apache Axis 1.x Web Service client framework.

- title: Authentication
  content: |
    The Booking API requires authentication for all its endpoints. See the [getting started guide on authentication](/api/#authentication) if you're not sure what this means.

    | Header | Example | Comment |
    |:-------|:--------|:--------|
    | `X-MyBring-API-Uid` | `john.doe@example.com` | Mybring login ID |
    | `X-MyBring-API-Key` | `1234abc-abcd-1234-5678-abcd1234abcd ` | Mybring login's API key |
    | `X-Bring-Client-URL` | `https://example.com/ ` | A URL that sort of identifies where you're using the APIs. | 

    Those headers must be set for all endpoints documented below.

- title: Authorization
  content: |
    In addition to authentication, you need to be authorized with the "booing" right in order to perform bookings. This is done in [customer administration in Mybring](https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/external/administration):

    ![Authorized for booking](booking_authorization.png)

    To perform a booking, you must specify which customer number to use. For your convenience, there is an [API for getting the customer numbers](#customers-endpoint) associated with your API user. The Customer Number API also links customer numbers with the products the customer number is valid for.

/customers{mediaTypeExtension}:
  displayName: List customer numbers
  description: |
      The customer numbers are prefixed with the specialist, followed by the number. For Courier and Bring Express-products, we use a UUID to identify users.

      The customer API will return for each specialist a list with the products that you can order through the booking API.

      You can also get the API customer numbers from [this page in Mybring](https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/apicustomernumber).

        displayName: Delivery Option
        description: |

          #### Attempted delivery

          If a sender want their package delivered to the door, and it cannot be delivered (i.e. Business closed or recipient is not present), then you can now choose what will happen with your package.

          If this option is not set, then the default behaviour is `TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_RETURN`.

          If you want Bring to try deliver only once and/or deliver package to nearest PiB, then you must tell us by setting this option. These options cost extra money but the customer/sender will only be charged if the event happen.

          Example:

          You send a package to a business with the `deliveryOption=TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_PIB`.

          - If Bring manage to deliver the package to the recipient on first try, then no extra charges is made.
          - If first attempt to deliver fails, then Bring will do a second attempt. The customer/sender will be charged extra.
          - If the second attempt also fails, then the package will be delivered to nearest PiB. The customer/sender will be charged extra.

          Possible options:

          - Not set = `TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_RETURN`
          - `ONE_DELIVERY_THEN_PIB`
          - `TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_PIB`
          - `TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_RETURN`

/pickupOrder:
  displayName: Order pickups
  description: |
    The Pickup Order Api is for ordering a single pickup at a particular address.

    Parcels Norway, Parcels Sweden, Parcels Denmark and Cargo Customers with a Mybring user ID can use this service. Customer numbers in this API is the same as to booking API, obtained either through your Mybring profile or the customer number API.

    Pickup in the different countries requires different customer numbers:

    | Customer number prefix | Pickup in country | Required information element |
    |:-----------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------------|
    | PARCELS_NORWAY         | Norway (parcels)  | `parcelsInformation`         |
    | CARGO                  | Norway (cargo)    | `cargoInformation`           |
    | PARCELS_NORWAY_INTERNATIONAL, PARCELS_SWEDEN, PARCELS_DENMARK, PARCELS_FINLAND BRING_DENMARK_AS | Sweden, Denmark | parcelsInternationalInformation |

    #### Pickup ordered by default with product CARGO_GROUPAGE from Bring Cargo

    A pickup order is necessary to get the goods collected for transportation by Bring Cargo but you don't have to worry about it when ordering with the API .

    A pickup will be automatically ordered together with the shipment when ordering a `CARGO_GROUPAGE` shipment.

    If you order many shipments the pickups will be aggregated by Bring Cargo to one pickup by place and date.
