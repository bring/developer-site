                  Sometimes (especially in Denmark) it's a good idea to also specify the address when searching for pickup points, to get more accurate results.

                  In [this example](https://api.bring.com/pickuppoint/api/pickuppoint/DK/postalCode/2000.json?street=Smallegade&streetNumber=3), we look for pickup points in Smallegade 3 and postal code 2000.

                  If you want to return only the pickup points matching a specific string, you may use the `searchForText` query param. The given text can be the name of the pickup point, its address, city, county, municipality or location. Partial matches are also allowed.

                  If you want you can also add `openOnOrBefore` and / or `openOnOrAfter`, to limit the search even more.
