            <h3>Selecting a shipping method&nbsp;<small><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/api/shipping-guide_2">Shipping Guide API</a></small></h3>
          </header>
          A shipping method is a way to fulfill delivery to customers of the goods that they purchased. The Shipping Guide API shows your customers which shipping methods are available; for example an express delivery,  parcels delivered to your door or perhaps a parcel that is paid on delivery.

Via the API you can also display, in addition to the address, the opening hours of the pickup point.

          Well-written applications include error-handling code that allows them to recover gracefully from unexpected errors. The order should still be intact, even if the Shipping Guide returns an error or a timeout occurs.
