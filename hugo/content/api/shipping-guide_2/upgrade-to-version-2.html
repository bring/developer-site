<h1 class="api__title">Upgrading to version 2.0</h1>
<section class="api__section">
  <p>
    This is a short summary of the differences between version 1.xx and 2.0 of
    the Shipping Guide API and will help you migrate to version 2.0 of the API.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend always updating to the latest version and to do it at your
    earliest convenience. Upgrading to the latest version maximizes the time
    between upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
    The older 1.xx versions will become deprecated and shut down some time in
    the future.

  <h2>SOAP and JSON interface</h2>
  <h3>What we have changed</h3>
  <p>
    This section describes the main changes we have done to both the SOAP and
    the JSON interface
  </p>
  <h4>Authentication is mandatory</h4>

  <p>
    Authentication is mandatory. If we know you better, we will be in better
    position to notify you about new features in future and also about changes
    to API in general. It is similar to
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/api/index#authentication/">authentication</a>
    process to what we had earlier. What is changed, we do not need to send
    X-Bring-Client-URL in headers now since you are already authenticated.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a new user, Signup
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user">here</a>. After login
    into Mybring, the API key will be generated by default. You will find your
    API key
    <a href="https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/">here</a>

    <br /><br />
    <b>Note:</b> If you are already using Mybring authentication, same API key
    could be reused.
  </p>

  <h4 class="anchored">Restructured error response</h4>
  <p>
    In version 1 of the Shipping Guide API client and server error responses are
    mainly a HTML document describing what went wrong, but in some cases trace
    messages are used. In version 2.0 this is changed to be easier to parse. You
    can read more about the new format of the errors in
    <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#handle-api-errors">Handle API errors</a> and
    <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/topics/#should-i-handle-warnings"
      >warnings.</a
    >
  </p>

  <h4 class="anchored">Introduced warnings</h4>
  <p>
    We have also introduced warnings on product level in Shipping guide
    response. Warnings are send out when Shipping guide is able to validate the
    request but missed some part of response for example Price or lead time due
    to unavailability of external systems. Ideally clients should not parse
    these warning codes for any logic as they are bound to change. These are
    supposed to be treated as informational data. Warning codes are documented
    in
    <a href="https://api.bring.com/shippingguide/api/ws/shipping-guide-20.xsd"
      >xsd</a
    >
    as well.
  </p>

  <h4 class="anchored">Trace messages are disabled by default for SOAP</h4>
  <p>
    Trace messages are now disabled by default and will not be send out in
    response. If in case you explicitly need trace messages then it has to be
    passed explicitly in request.
  </p>

  <h4 class="anchored">Query params for REST endpoint</h4>
  <p>
    Some of the query params of
    <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/#get-shipment-prices-and-estimated-delivery"
      >REST</a
    >
    endpoint has slightly changed its name and they are not in camel case
    anymore. Meaning and functionality remains the same.
  </p>

<section class="api__section">
  <h2>SOAP interface</h2>
  <h3>What we have removed in Request</h3>
  <h4>Request properties</h4>
  <p>
    The tag is no longer available, as we have moved all its tags up to be
    parent tag, ShippingGuideRequest
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>WithPackageDetails</code> tag is no longer available, as we have
    discontinued package based shipping guide request.
  </p>

  <h4>TimeSlots tag</h4>
  <p>The tag is removed and no longer available.</p>

  <h4>Consignment and Packages tags</h4>
  <p>
    These tags are no longer available. From schema version 9, we introduced
    Consignments tag which consists of all of these tags.
  </p>

  <p>
    In shipping guide, every request can contain one or many consignments with
    shipments details, product ids, and package details (packages can be one or
    many).
  </p>

  <p>
    So in Shipping guide 2.0, we have generalised it, and removed all the
    individual tags which are already part of Consignments tag.
  </p>

  <h4>Unit code for dimension in Consignments tag</h4>
  <p>
    unitCode is removed from the measurements LxWxH. The unit used is standard
    metric measurements units.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Length, width, and height can only be requested in centimeters</li>
    <li>Weight can only be requested in grams.</li>
    <li>Volume can only be requested in dm3.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Consignment tag in Consignments tag</h4>
  <p>
    This tag is just unwrapped, all the tags are still present, but not grouped.
    They are now part of the parent tag. Refer schema of Shipping Guide 2.0.
  </p>

  <h3>What we have changed in Request</h3>

  <h4>ConsignmentId attribute in Consignments tag</h4>
  <p>The attribute is renamed to Id only.</p>

  <h4>AdditionalServiceId tag under the AdditionalService tag</h4>
  <p>The attribute is renamed to Id only.</p>

  <h4>ProductIds tag and its children</h4>
  <p>The ProductIds tag is now called Products.</p>
  <p>
    For each previous ProductId tag, we now have a new tag called Product. All
    the previous attributes of the ProductId tag, are now moved to separate
    nested tags under the Product tag.
  </p>
  <p>The ProductId tag is now in a tag called Id.</p>
  <p>
    The customerNumber attribute is now moved to a separate tag called
    CustomerNumber.
  </p>
  <p>
    The autoSelectCustomerNumber attribute is now moved to a separate tag called
    AutoSelectCustomerNumber.
  </p>
  <p>
    The whichPartyIsPayer attribute is now moves to a separate tag called Payer
    with these valid values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>SENDER</code></li>
    <li><code>RECEIVER</code></li>
    <li><code>THIRD_PARTY</code></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What we have changed in response</h3>
  <h4>ProductId</h4>
  <p><code>ProductId</code> element is renamed to <code>Id</code>.</p>

  <h4>CustomerNumber</h4>
  <p><code>CustomerNumber</code> attribute is changed to being an element.</p>
  <h4>ProductCodeInProductionSystem</h4>
  <p>
    <code>ProductCodeInProductionSystem</code>element is renamed to
    <code>ProductionCode</code>.
  </p>
  <h4>EDI information</h4>
  <p>
    <code>CourierSpecificEdiParameters</code>,
    <code>QuickpackSpecificEdiParametersType</code> and
    <code>UpsSpecificEdiParametersType</code> elements are grouped inside a
    <code>Edi</code> element and the names are shortened, i.e.
    "SpecificEdiParametersType" is removed from the names.
  </p>
  <h4>Price information</h4>
  <p>
    <code>Price</code> is renamed to <code>ListPrice</code> and that element,
    <code>NetPrice</code> and <code>PipSpecificPrice</code> are grouped inside a
    <code>Price</code> element.
  </p>
  <h3>What we have removed in Response</h3>

  <h4>Packages and Consignment response tags</h4>
  <p>
    These tags are removed for we don't support individual package level and
    consignment level requests anymore.
  </p>

  <h4>Consignments response tag</h4>
  <p>
    Trace messages and packages are removed, we have generalised a the response
    a lot, for better response format and parsing.
  </p>
  <h5>Products tag</h5>
  <p>
    This tag is has all the existing fields with few more added fields. Like
    Error and warning tags, for better error, handling. For more information,
    kindly refer the schema Shipping Guide 2.0
  </p>
</section>
<section class="api__section">
  <h2>JSON interface</h2>

  <p>
    The overall response of all the three REST APIs is same, and conforms
    Shipping Guide 2.0 schema. So, response tags of REST API follow the previous
    section as well.
  </p>

  <h3>What we have removed</h3>
  <h4>Price adjustment</h4>
  <p>
    We do not support price adjustment in Shipping Guide 2.0. The pricing model
    is very simple now. It should be very easy to do price adjustment at client
    side.
  </p>
